      <p>Coming back to Mahendranagar as a doctor was emotional. Treating familiar faces during the pandemic was one of the most rewarding yet challenging chapters of my journey.</p>
      <p>I managed emergency cases, ICU patients, and COVID-19 wards — often without enough resources. Yet, being able to serve my community directly brought me purpose.</p>
      <p>We also ran awareness programs, supported families of critically ill patients, and trained new health workers in pandemic response protocols.</p>
