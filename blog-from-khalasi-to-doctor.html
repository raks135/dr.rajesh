      <p>I was raised in a quiet village called Basantpur, nestled beside the Mahakali River. As a child, I would walk along its banks, wondering what the future might hold. Coming from a middle-class family, the dream of studying medicine once felt out of reach. But my story has always been about persistence, growth, and belief in the journey ahead.</p>

      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúLife's a road, not made to stay,<br>

        Each story holds a unique name.‚Äù

      <p>My curiosity for diagnostic reasoning and patient-centered care deepened during my time as a medical officer. One case in particular stands out...</p>

      <p>I am excited about training in the U.S. because of the emphasis on evidence-based practice, interdisciplinary collaboration, and continuous learning...</p>

      <p>Looking ahead, I envision myself practicing as an internist who not only delivers excellent clinical care but also contributes to underserved populations...</p>
