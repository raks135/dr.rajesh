      <p>We're making history with inclusive care for LGBTQI+ patients. Partnering with Blue Diamond Society and Kathmandu Medical College, I helped implement a gender-affirmative healthcare policy.</p>
      <p>We trained staff on appropriate pronoun usage, confidentiality, and sensitive health screening for trans and queer patients. We also offered free counseling services.</p>
      <p>Healthcare must evolve with compassion, and this experience gave me hope that Nepal is moving toward dignity and respect for all patients.</p>
